The game leader chooses a number between 1 and 100. This is the secret the other team members will try to guess.\n1. To keep everyone honest, the game leader writes the number on a piece of paper and hands it to the record keeper.\n1. Repeat until the secret number is guessed\n    1. Guessers say a number\n    1.
